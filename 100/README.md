# 100 - Getting Started

This section lists the different ways to set up and run Kubernetes. When you install Kubernetes, choose an installation type based on: ease of maintenance, security, control, available resources, and expertise required to operate and manage a cluster.

You can deploy a Kubernetes cluster on a local machine, cloud, on-prem datacenter, or choose a managed Kubernetes cluster. There are also custom solutions across a wide range of cloud providers, or bare metal environments.
